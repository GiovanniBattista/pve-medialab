#---- BLACKLIST OR WHITELIST A FOLDER FROM VIDCODERR -------------------------------
# 
# Vidcoderr uses the video folder name to whitelist or blacklist media. 
# To manage media folder whitelisting and blacklisting in Vidcoderr, please follow
# the format provided below. Each entry should consist of three fields separated
# by ';' characters.
#
# Field 1:
# Use 'B' or 'b' to blacklist a folder, preventing it from being encoded.
# Use 'W' or 'w' to whitelist a folder, ensuring Vidcoderr does not prune encoded
# videos from the '-- video/stream' folder (lifespan forever).
# 
# Field 2:
# Specify the location of the media using the following source category
# paths exactly as shown:
# 
#     -- homevideo
#     -- video/documentary
#     -- video/movies
#     -- video/musicvideos
#     -- video/pron
#     -- video/series
# 
# Field 3:
# Enter the video folder name in this field, not the video file name. To match
# partial folder names, use the wildcard '*' at the end of the entry.
# 
# Example blacklisted folders:
# 
#     -- b;video/movies;What We Did*
#     Blacklists all movie folders starting with "What We Did".
#     -- b;video/movies;What We Did on Our Holiday (2014)
#     Blacklists only the movie folder "What We Did on Our Holiday (2014)".
# 
# Example whitelisted folders:
# 
#     -- w;video/series;All Creatures Great*
#     Whitelists all series folders starting with "All Creatures Great".
#     -- w;video/movies;Toy Story (2019)
#     Whitelists only the movie folder "Toy Story (2019)".
